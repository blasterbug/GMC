\Subsection{Ordering}
	Message ordering is a central part of distributed communication to make sure that problems that arise by using unreliable networks does not affect the execution of a distributed system.
	This middleware handles causal ordering and unordered messaging, both described here.

	\Subsubsection{Causal ordering}
		Causal message ordering uses logical clocks to timestamp messages.
		These are vector clocks which contains one entry for all senders, incremented every time a message is sent from that sender.
		These vector clocks are used to establish a happens-before relationship between messages.
		This is used to hold messages until all that were logically sent previously are recieved and delivered.
		It is also possible to detect concurrency in message communication using vector clocks, these should be delivered and not held back.
		This means that a new member joining must share the vector clock currently existing in the group.

	\Subsubsection{Unordered}
		This ordering method does exactly what is says, delivers messages as they are received.

\Subsection{Multicast}

\paragraph{}{
    To send the messages to the differents node of the network,
 which are the members of a group, we implemented three differents
 strtategies. There are briefly presented below.
}

\begin{itemize}
    \iten[unreliable multicast] This strategy only send messages
        to the member of the view...
    \item[reliable multicast]
    \item[tree based multicast]


\end{itemize}

\Subsection{Group management}
	Group management in a distributed system has responsibilities additional to usual group management tasks such as \texttt{join}, \texttt{leave} and \texttt{create} groups.
	Two things in particular are to be considered
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Scalability}: How much information does the group management need?
		\item \textbf{Partitioning}: What happens if part of the group is unable to reach another part of the group?
	\end{itemize}

	The scalability is an issue as distributed systems should be able to encompass a hugh amount of nodes without affecting performance to a great extent.
	This means that the amount of information a single node should keep about the group should be minimal.

	The partitioning is a problem which is present for other types of systems as well, but in the case of distributed systems it is necessary to handle this as a system distributed over a network should still function and be perceived as a single unit.
	Therefore, being able to reconstruct groups and function as separate groups while during the partitioning is important.
