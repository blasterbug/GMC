The work done on Gcom has been rewarding and an interesting insight in how distributed communication works and what problems there are.
Some parts of the solution could be improved on, like how the communication layer is implemented, but the overall solution satisfies.

The project group has been affected by things external to the course which greatly delayed the development.
One thing that could have been done to facilitate the development would have been to complete the debug interface earlier in the project.
It would have made it easier to prepare the test protocol.
