\Section{Project Plan}

	In this section a project plan for the GCom project is presented, including task deadlines and how the work should be carried out.

	\Subsection{Identified tasks}
		Here is a list of identified tasks (not ordered) which needs to be completed in order for the project to meet its requirements.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Implement vector clocks
			\item Implement FIFO ordering
			\item Implement Casual ordering
			\item Implement Total ordering
			\item Implement Non-reliable multicast
			\item Implement Reliable multicast
			\item Implement Tree-based multicast
			\item Implement naming service
			\item Create interfaces between layers
			\item Construct interface for debug application
			\item Build distributed group chat application
			\item Build debug application
			\item Specify test protocol
			\item Get to know Java RMI
			\item Handle communication errors
			\item Handle group membership changes
			\item Resolve group names
			\item Write final report
			\item Demonstrate solution
		\end{itemize}

		These tasks can in turn be broken down into smaller subtasks which are presented in the time plan.

		What is not presented here is the time plan for the design phase of the project, it feels like a waste\footnote{See Agile development methods} to add this here as that phase is over\footnote{Not saying that we should stop designing tho'}.

	\Subsection{Execution}
		The tools described in Section 2 will be used so that the team can work efficiently without being bound by time or place.
		In order for the work to go smoothly it will however be necessary to meet at least once a day to clarify questions as fast as possible.
		One thing to consider is different time schedules and fluctuating work loads over the weeks, partially managed by using e.g. Git.
		Whether to go for the bonus points will be decided half way through.
